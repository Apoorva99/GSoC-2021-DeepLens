# GSoC-2021-DeepLens

* **Task_1** corresponds to the Common Test I: Simulating Superfluid Dark Matter (DM) with PyAutoLens and **Task_1.ipynb** contains the code for the same.

* **Task_2** corresponds to the Specific Test IV: Exploring Equivariant Neural Networks that was associated with my project Equivariant Neural Networks for Dark Matter Morphology with Strong Gravitational Lensing .  **Task_2.ipynb** contains the code for the same and  **Task_2.pdf** contains the documentation of the the work done. The model weights for the network can be downloaded and used from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RltqiiGyDmYWh7Od7FUA_eIt7TYSDwuB/view.
